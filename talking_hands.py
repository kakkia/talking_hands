When speaking Italian it is mandatory that you express your emotions with your hands. \n
#TalkingHands is the first image classification app that will help you to express your emotions when you just canâ€™t find the words. \n
For my final project in Data Science at the WBS Coding School, I trained a convolutional neural network to automatically classify three different hand gestures commonly used in Italy. You will be finally able to understand Italians by looking at their hands!\n
So far the model has only been trained with:""")
