# Talking Hands
The fine art of Italian gestures

#TalkingHands is the first image classification app that will help you to express your emotions when you just can’t find the words. 

For my final project in Data Science at the WBS Coding School, I trained a convolutional neural network (CNN) to automatically classify three different hand gestures commonly used in Italy. You will be finally able to understand Italians by looking at their hands!

Do you want to give us a hand? On <a href="https://share.streamlit.io/kakkia/talking_hands/main/streamlit_hp.py">my Streamlit app</a> you can upload a picture of your gesture and you will find how what it means and how to use it.
