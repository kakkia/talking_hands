# Talking Hands
The fine art of Italian gestures

#TalkingHands is the first image classification app that will help you to use Italian hand gestures to express your emotions when you just canâ€™t find the words. 

For my Data Science final project at the WBS Coding School I trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to automatically classify three different hand gestures commonly used in Italy.
